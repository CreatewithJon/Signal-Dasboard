> A personal AI operating system for the AI-powered digital era. This roadmap covers the evolution from Signal Dashboard into a fully realized Sovereign OS.

_Last updated: 2026-06-19 (v7.1)_

---

## Phase 4.0 — Supabase Foundation (Complete)
_Install Supabase client, define schema, add status visibility and docs. No data movement yet._

- [x] `npm install @supabase/supabase-js` — package installed
- [x] `lib/supabase/client.ts` — `getSupabaseClient()` singleton; returns null when env vars missing; app continues in local-only mode unchanged
- [x] `lib/supabase/server.ts` — `getSupabaseServer()` for Route Handlers and Server Components; created per-request, never at module level
- [x] `lib/supabase/status.ts` — `getSupabaseStatus()` returns configured/urlPresent/anonKeyPresent/mode; safe on client or server
- [x] `supabase/schema.sql` — 9 tables: profiles, projects, project_tasks, memory_items, content_items, focus_sessions, planner_entries, habits, habit_logs. jsonb for arrays/metadata. Indexes. `set_updated_at()` trigger. RLS notes for v4.3.
- [x] `docs/SUPABASE_SYNC_PLAN.md` — architecture doc: sync strategy, conflict handling, migration phases v4.0–v4.4, backup approach, workspace architecture
- [x] `/settings` page rebuilt from placeholder → real page: Persistence Mode panel, Supabase status, setup steps, Sync Roadmap, Data Export button, System Info
- [x] `components/settings/StorageExport.tsx` — exports all sovereign_ keys to dated JSON backup file
- [x] Settings "Soon" badge removed from sidebar; active-state detection extended to system nav
- [x] **No Supabase reads or writes** — localStorage remains sole source of truth. v4.1 adds dual-write.
- [x] All lint/typecheck/build clean

## Phase 4.1 — Dual Write: Memory (Complete)
_Memory items write to localStorage + Supabase in parallel._

- [x] `lib/repositories/memoryRepository.ts` — `DualWriteResult`, `saveMemoryItemDual`, `deleteMemoryItemDual`
- [x] `/memory` page — async capture/save/delete with sync status indicator ("Saving…" / "Synced ✓" / "Saved locally")
- [x] `AIPanel.tsx` — `commitSave()` async; shows "Saved + synced" vs "Saved locally"
- [x] `components/settings/MemorySyncStatus.tsx` — live item count + sync mode
- [x] `/settings` — Memory Store section + roadmap v4.1 marker

## Phase 4.2 — Dual Write: All Core Modules (Complete)
_Projects, Tasks, Content, Focus Sessions all dual-write to localStorage + Supabase._

- [x] `lib/repositories/projectRepository.ts` — Projects + ProjectTasks; `upsertProjectSupabase`, `upsertProjectTaskSupabase`, `deleteProjectTaskSupabase`; full dual-write helpers
- [x] `lib/repositories/contentRepository.ts` — ContentItems; `upsertContentItemSupabase`; full dual-write helpers
- [x] `lib/repositories/focusSessionRepository.ts` — FocusSessions; `upsertFocusSessionSupabase`; full dual-write helper; camelCase→snake_case row mapper
- [x] `/projects` page — all mutations fire background Supabase upserts (reorder excluded — no order field in schema)
- [x] `ContentPipeline.tsx` — `handleSave`/`handleArchive` fire background upserts; `saveToMemory` uses `saveMemoryItemDual`
- [x] `/focus` page — `persistSessions(updated, changed)` fires background Supabase upsert; `handleSaveReview` memory save uses `saveMemoryItemDual`
- [x] `/settings` — Sync Coverage table (5 modules covered, Planner/Habits local-only); roadmap v4.2 current; version v4.2

## Phase 4.3 — Sync Health + Manual Restore (Complete)
_Per-module sync status visibility and backup restore in settings._

- [x] `lib/supabase/syncHealth.ts` — `recordSyncResult()` + `getSyncHealth()` report
- [x] All repositories call `recordSyncResult()` after every Supabase write attempt
- [x] `components/settings/SyncHealth.tsx` — per-module table with local counts + last-sync results
- [x] `StorageExport.tsx` rewritten — Export (unchanged) + Restore from Backup (new, with preview + confirmation)
- [x] `lib/keys.ts` — `KEYS.SYNC_STATUS` added

## Phase 4.4 — Auth Readiness (Complete)
_Optional Supabase auth; user_id prep; app stays fully local._

- [x] `/settings` — Identity & Auth section; v4.4 current in roadmap
- [x] `docs/SUPABASE_AUTH_PLAN.md` — auth modes, RLS plan, migration strategy, workspace architecture
- [x] App works identically for anonymous users — no gating, no forced login

## Phase 4.5 — Migration Assistant (Complete)
_Manual opt-in migration of localStorage data to Supabase._

- [x] `lib/supabase/localMigration.ts` — `analyzeLocalDataForMigration()` (dry run) + `migrateLocalDataToSupabase()` (write, requires auth)
- [x] `components/settings/MigrationAssistant.tsx` — analyze → preview → confirm → migrate → result flow; 6 UI phases
- [x] Auth gate: shows "Sign in first" message when not authenticated
- [x] Dry-run table: local count, eligible count, skipped count, warnings per module
- [x] Confirmation checkbox required before migration runs
- [x] Continue-on-error: individual item failures tracked, migration continues
- [x] Result table: succeeded/failed per module with error messages
- [x] localStorage never modified at any step

- [x] Reverse row mappers for all 5 modules: camelCase local types ↔ snake_case Supabase rows
- [x] Two restore modes: `replace_local_module` (discard local, write Supabase) + `merge_by_id` (last-write-wins by `updated_at`)
- [x] Backup: `backupLocalModule()` triggers browser download of current localStorage module before any write
- [x] Validation: `isNonEmptyString()` guards; invalid rows skipped and counted, never written
- [x] Auth required: `getCachedUserId() !== null` gate
- [x] Supabase rows never modified or deleted at any step
- [x] `components/settings/SupabaseRestore.tsx` — 6-phase UI: idle → previewing → preview (module cards) → confirm (mode picker + checkbox) → restoring → done/error
- [x] ModuleCard: click-to-select; shows local/Supabase counts and diff label
- [x] Done phase: full result detail (fetched, valid, invalid, new/updated/kept, total written)

## Phase 6.4 — Product Readiness Audit (Complete)
_Pre-commercial stability audit: route coverage, feature overlap analysis, data safety, mobile polish, and bug fixes._

- [x] **Route audit** — Verified all 14 major routes load, have nav links, and have empty states. `/chief` silent-null bug fixed. `/opportunities` and `/brand` confirmed as secondary (not in MobileNav, acceptable).
- [x] **Feature overlap analysis** — Documented Chief/Strategy/Goals/Review/Actions/Focus/Briefing as intentionally layered by timeframe. Identified `/briefing` rename opportunity, `/leads` sidebar cleanup, `/narrative` consolidation as v6.5 candidates. No deletions yet.
- [x] **Bug fix: OverdueDigest hardcoded keys** — `components/OverdueDigest.tsx` used raw string constants instead of `KEYS` registry. Fixed to import and use `KEYS.PROJECTS` / `KEYS.PROJECT_TASKS`. Prevents silent drift if key names change.

- [x] **Data safety audit** — `safeRead`/`safeWrite` pattern confirmed on 100% of localStorage reads. Key registry centralized. Export/restore flow confirmed gold standard. Focus session stuck-state risk documented.
- [x] **Mobile audit** — Tested patterns at 375/390/430px. 4 specific issues fixed above. 2 remaining (modal max-h, iOS safe-area-inset) deferred to v6.5.
- [x] `docs/PRODUCT_READINESS_AUDIT.md` — Full audit doc: route table, feature overlap map, data safety findings, mobile issue tracker, pre-commercial checklist, known risks, next 5 commits.
- [x] `PROJECT_STATE.md` + `ROADMAP.md` updated to v6.4

## Phase 6.3 — Executive Dashboard Polish (Complete)
_Reorganises the Command Center into a clean executive operating dashboard with clear zones and a "Today's Command" hero._

- [x] `components/TodayCommand.tsx` — "Today's Command" hero: 4-cell command grid (Top Action, Risk, Top Objective, Focus status), momentum score pill header, date label, executive summary excerpt, CTA buttons (Review Week + Start/Continue Focus). Computes full chief + strategy chain from localStorage. Active-session-aware.
- [x] `components/CollapsibleZone.tsx` — Reusable zone wrapper: label + accent gradient divider + chevron toggle. Persists state in sessionStorage (via useEffect, not useState initializer, to avoid SSR hydration mismatch). Extra slot for right-side additions.
- [x] `components/DashboardShell.tsx` — Client shell: compact header (title + HeroStats pills), SystemStatus, TodayCommand, then 5 collapsible zones: Executive (Chief/Strategy/Goals/Review 2×2), Execution (Actions full + Briefing/Focus 2-col), Operating (Projects/Content/Relationships/Memory 2×2 with OverdueDigest in header), Signal (BTC/Stack + Productivity/Habits), AI. All default open.
- [x] `app/page.tsx` — Simplified to pure server component: fetch BTC, check env, pass props to DashboardShell. Old marketing hero, SectionDivider, and all direct card imports removed.
- [x] Mobile: 2-col grids collapse to stacked on `sm:` breakpoint. No horizontal scroll. Header layout switches to stacked. Zone labels remain legible at all widths.

## Phase 6.2 — Weekly Review Engine (Complete)
_Reviews the current week: completed work, slipped items, wins, blockers, habit consistency, focus stats, strategic alignment, and next-week focus._

- [x] `lib/weeklyReview/engine.ts` — `computeWeeklyReview(input)`: pure deterministic review engine. Week bounds (Mon–Sun), `findCompletedWork()` (tasks Done + updated_at in week, content Published, opps Converted, focus sessions Completed), `findSlippedItems()` (tasks due in week not done, content with publish_date not published, follow-ups <= weekEnd not actioned), `findWins()` (task count, content published, habit ≥70%, focus ≥3 sessions, opps converted), `findBlockers()` (paused projects, active high-priority with no tasks, tasks overdue >14d), `findRelationshipFollowUps()` (due by weekEnd, sorted by priority), `analyzeContentProgress()` (created/movedReady/published this week), `analyzeHabitConsistency()` (score, completionByDay, perfectDays, bestStreak, lowestHabit), `analyzeFocusStats()` (completed/abandoned, totalMinutes, avg, longest, topProject), `analyzeStrategicAlignment()` (completed task projectIds vs top 3 objectives' relatedProjects), `buildRecommendations()` (up to 7: critical slipped, high slipped, blockers, habit rebuild, strategic realignment, action engine top, overdue follow-up), `buildNextWeekFocus()` (up to 5: slipped tasks, strategic objective next action, action engine top, overdue follow-up, slipped content).

Theme detection (ai/bitcoin/content/dwt/education/revenue/relationships/general via regex). Per objective: `deriveMilestones()` (30d foundation + optional validation for hard/very-hard + 60d momentum + 90d outcome), `suggestTasks()` (6 templates per theme, deduped against existing open tasks), `suggestContent()` (3 content ideas per theme with format/platform/angle, deduped against existing titles), `suggestFollowUps()` (linked-project people first, then theme-matched templates with existing person preference), `suggestOpportunities()` (2 per theme, deduped against existing). Output: `DecompositionResult` with `decomposedGoals[]` + totals.
- [x] `app/goals/page.tsx` — Full goal decomposition page. Accordion per objective (first open by default). Milestones timeline (30d/60d/90d badges). Suggested tasks with inline project picker (dropdown). Content with format/platform/angle. Follow-ups with Schedule/Save Note. Opportunities with Track button. "Save to Memory" per goal. All conversions write to localStorage. Empty state with /planner link.

- [x] `lib/vector/vectorDb.ts` — `probeVectorDb(supabase)`: PostgREST column probe (`.select("embedding").limit(0)`); detects 42703 "undefined column" error; returns `{ columnExists, ready }`
- [x] `app/api/vector/status/route.ts` — Dynamic 4-state mode detection (`deterministic-only` → `embedding-provider-ready` → `vector-db-ready` → `semantic-active`). Probes Supabase via `probeVectorDb`; no hardcoded flags.
- [x] `app/api/vector/embed/route.ts` — Embedding persistence: after generating embedding, probes pgvector readiness; if ready, writes `embedding`, `embedding_model`, `embedded_at` to Supabase `memory_items`. Returns `{ persisted: boolean }`.
- [x] `app/api/vector/search/route.ts` — Server-side semantic search: `POST { query, limit }` → generates query embedding → calls `match_memories` Supabase RPC → returns `{ status, ids, source }`. Falls back to keyword at every failure point.
- [x] `lib/vector/semanticMemory.ts` — Removed `VECTOR_DB_READY = false` flag. Semantic path activated: `createEmbedding()` → dynamic `getSupabaseClient()` import → `supabase.rpc("match_memories", ...)`. Graceful fallback at every step.
- [x] `components/AIPanel.tsx` — Fetches `/api/vector/status` on mount; when `semantic-active`, calls `/api/vector/search` per message; merges semantic IDs with keyword results (semantic-first, keyword fill, cap 5); shows `⚡ semantic` badge in context indicator.

## Architecture Notes

### Signal → Sovereign OS migration decisions
- **localStorage keys kept as `signal_`** — renaming would destroy existing data for no user benefit
- **`/narrative` route preserved** — `/memory` redirects there; will evolve when Phase 5 is built
- **Auth cookie** — middleware checks `sovereign-auth` first, falls back to `signal-auth` for existing sessions
- **Same GitHub repo** — commit history, Vercel deployment, and all integrations unchanged

### Future infrastructure
- Consider migrating localStorage to a Supabase table when multi-device sync is needed
- Consider adding `@anthropic-ai/sdk` for cleaner streaming support
- AI usage should eventually route through Helicone for observability
